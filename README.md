## Executing the shell

### Compile
```bash
cd project/src
make clean; make mysh
```

### Run

#### Interactive Mode

```bash
./mysh
```

#### Batch Mode

```bash
./mysh < testfile.txt
```

## Starter Code

I used my code from the previous assignment A1 as my staring point for this assignment. The code from A1 did use the started code for that assignment

## Test Script

I have provided a test script to automatically compile the shell and run all the test-cases. 

It can be executed by running the following command:

```bash
./test-cases/test.sh
```

Additionally, there is a second script to test individual test files. 

```bash
./test-cases/test_script.sh <script_name>
```
